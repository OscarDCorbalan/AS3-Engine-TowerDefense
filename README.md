# ActionScript 3 engine - Tower Defense
**This repo only includes liberated code, but not any kind of assets of which I still keep the copyright**

This is an engine developed with an event-oriented model, to build tower defense games on top of it by adding assets and extending classes.

## Building / Compiling

**This engine is implemented in plain ActionScript plus the Adobe Flash framework**, so it can be either played on any browser through Flash Player or compiled to any platform (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS) through Adobe AIR.

Please note that to build the game you should:
  1. Fork/download this repo.
  2. Provide the necessary (even stub) assets. If you use Adobe Flash it will point to missing/needed asset files.
